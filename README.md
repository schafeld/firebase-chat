# Firebase-Chat
A basic chat app based on Firebase

Based on a [Google Firebase tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web#1), [starter code](https://github.com/firebase/codelab-friendlychat-web).

## Instructions and notes

Run Firebase app locally:
```shell
firebase serve --only hosting
```

With local server running, configuration files with app details like URLs are inspectable, e.g. by visiting:
```shell
http://localhost:5000/__/firebase/init.js
